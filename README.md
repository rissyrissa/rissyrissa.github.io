# Learn All About my Cavapoo Site!
The Story Behind it All! :
Growing up with parents with origins outside of the US, dogs as pets was more of a running
joke than anything else. For 10 years, I asked my parents for a dog and every year, they said no. Until 2020 when my Dad told me to make a business proposal and presentation on getting a dog
for a pet. I made it my mission and two presentations later, the family started looking for dogs. This went on for 3 months until we finally brought Oreo home.

Intention of the Site:
To provide a website that lists all the pros and cons of getting a cavapoo dog and how to prepare for bringing your first dog home.

What's Unique About this Site:
Since cavapoos are a "designer breed", its mostly common to get them from breeders over shelters. However, my site breaksdown the finances of both choices as well as the average cost of other materials. One of the pages provides users with different Youtube videos; two videos are from vloggers who have adopted cavapoos while the other two videos reference Racheal Frusaro's Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/rachelfusaro). Fusaro is a well-known Internet celebrity who's devotion to dogs are shown through her nutritional, behavioral training and care videos.
