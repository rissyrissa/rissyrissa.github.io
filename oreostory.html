                    <p>We came across Oreo (back then he was Echo)<br>
                        on the Lancaster website. The breeders were <br>
                        mennonite farmers in PA; not only was the house <br>
                        clean when we got there, but little Echo was playing <br>
                        with his siblings comfortably. We made a few visits to see <br>
                        him, with each visit asking the breeders more questions <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>On the 15th, my Mom and I made one last trip, <br>
                    only this time it was to pick Echo up. And boy was <br>
                    fun! Most puppies are full of energy, but this one <br>
                    so calm and just curious about the world. When we <br>
                    brought him home, we renamed Echo to Oreo!!

                    <p>At this point, Oreo's fur is fully grown and <br>
                    he's potty-trained! His calm personality is more <br>
                    unhinged since he's now used to the family and  <br>
                    our overall dynamic. In the photo, you can see <br>
                    chilling outside during the 4th of July

                    <p>Now 2 years old, Oreo has gotten bigger and <br>
                    more bold with his choices. He's gotten the idea <br>
                    that he could drive as shown here and also became <br>
                    more rebellious around the house. This called for <br>
                    more training, which made him remember the rules <br>
                    of the household itself.

                    <p>With me off to school, Oreo had to learn the hard way <br>
                    that I was no longer going to be in the house often. <br>
                    Mom reported a some anxiety and even depression in <br>
                    Oreo's behavior. Which is why she and Jacob made it <br>
                    their mission to spend lots of time with him! He's <br>
                    visited to Mount many times, however he's given <br>
                    quality care and time at home and now he's much <br>
                    better!

                    <p>Nowadays, Oreo is living his best life back at home. <br>
                    Sure he's still the same chill puppy he was before <br>
                    But now as a 5 year old Cavapoo, he's proven to not <br>
                    only be the favorite in the family, but a great <br>
                    reminder that cavapoos are by far the best breeds <br>
                    there is! <br>
